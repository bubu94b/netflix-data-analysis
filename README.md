# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis — EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix's content catalog.  
As a passionate fan of anime (One Piece, Tokyo Ghoul, Vinland Saga), K-dramas (Itaewon Class, Weak Hero, Save Me), and movies like Interstellar, Harry Potter, and The Lord of the Rings, I wanted to explore how well these genres and titles are represented on Netflix — and what broader trends can be uncovered through data.
